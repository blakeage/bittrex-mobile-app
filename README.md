# Bittrex.com Mobile App
An Unofficial mobile app for [bittrex.com](http://bittrex.com) crypto-currency exchange 

## Purpose 
The purpose of the project is to build a mobile app consuming the bittrex.com API.

## Technology
The app is built in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native), and uses [Redux](http://redux.js.org) for state management. It is currently a work-in-progress, with READ-only capability.

API keys are currently hard-coded in the app.

## Initial Goals
Initial support is for READ-only access to the API, with the ability to trade coming afterwards.
